Progress: Implement my own bilateral filtering
Question: 
1. the paper, how is the technique applied to make it fast
2. Run time: bilateral O(r^2), median O(r)


Next step: 
1. Will it help to do filtering multiple times. (not smooth enough for noise or over-smooth stars)
2. Consider to do pre-processing, for detected stars, either change the params values, or not apply the filter, etc. -> to smooth the noise enough but not make the stars blurred. (YES!)
